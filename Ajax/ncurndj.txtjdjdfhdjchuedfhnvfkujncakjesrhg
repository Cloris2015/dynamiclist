Hi Jay,

I hope you are enjoying the snow day.

Will you accept H1-B transfer? I have H4 visa now but I got H1-B visa in 2013 and it can be extended through 2019. I can start to work once I get my H1-B transfered(minimum processing time is 2 weeks).

It would be great if you could provide H1-B sponsorship. If not, I can go to the awesome KEDEAKMEJ. But I would not like watching babyish boring videos. The videos I like are epic Minecraft ones! I also prefer Pokemon.
